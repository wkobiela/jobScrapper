# jobScrapper

## Description
Simple python project, that should make it easier to be up to date with jobs offers. Websites like BulldogJob, Nofluffjobs or JustJoinIt have this nasty fature - job offers that are "refreshed" are bumped to the top of the page, so it is easy to get lost of track and even apply to the same job twice. 

This combined scrapper uses excel sheet to write down all jobs offers, that match search patterns. On subsequent starts it will check found offers against excel, exclude ones that are already scrapped and write new ones on the top as inserted rows. 

You can edit this excel, mark with color offers that are intresting (or not), even hide rows. Just do not delete them, as this is reference info for scrapper.

Best way to run this project, would be to use cron and run this regularly on schedule. This way you can yeasily organise your IT work searching process - and most important - stop waisting your time on looking through hundreds of offers every day. 

5min is enough to browse the latest.

Currently there are 3 websites supported:
- nofluffjobs
- bulldogjob
- justjoinit

That would be nice, to include more.

## How to run
Install requirements using pip:
```
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
To setup script, edit `runner.py` and insert role, level and city you are looking for. This parameters are a little bit different for every website, but not that much.
```
EXCEL_NAME = 'jobs.xlsx'
NOFLUFFJOBS_SHEET = 'NoFluffJobs'
BULLDOGJOB_SHEET = 'BulldogJob'
JUSTJOINIT_SHEET = 'JustJoinIt'
```
`setup` will create excel named `jobs.xlsx` with 3 sheets. Do not bother with this as this point, consider it static.
